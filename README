The scripts on this branch are provided to give information about some
aspects of how bsd-games development formerly worked.  Because they
include hard-coded paths and references to a Subversion repository,
they will not be directly usable by a new maintainer.

The make-bsd script (which uses the sed script xsubst.sed) was used to
identify changes between the upstream NetBSD sources and this package,
by copying a "base" directory with the upstream NetBSD sources to
"netbsd", and a "games" directory with the sources of this package to
"linux", and then modifying both those copies to reduce the number of
mechanical changes appearing in the differences.  The residual
differences between the "netbsd" and "linux" directories should
include all the differences needing resolving (e.g. by merging
upstream to NetBSD), but may also include some changes not appropriate
to merge upstream to NetBSD.

The make-release script was used to tag releases and build release
tarballs.  In particular, it shows the logic for which files and
directories went in the free and non-free tarballs.
